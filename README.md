# 3D-simulations-of-macropinocytosis
codes for Saito and Sawai, iScience 2021

Uploaded files are as follows.
C++ Codes for simulation of macropinocytosis:
macropinocytosis_Fig2.cc, macropinocytosis_Fig6.cc, macropinocytosis_FigS1.cc,
codes for visualizing results:
visualize2D_png.cc, visualize6D_png.cc,
and data file 
dat_Fig.S1_F2.0at2.8.dat.

The codes for 3D simulation (macropinocytosis_Fig2.cc, macropinocytosis_Fig6.cc) require GPU computing with the open-acc compiler (pgi compiler was used).
The following compile option is used (mt19937ar.cc and mt19937ar.h are for Mersenne twister):
pgc++ macropinocytosis_Fig2.cc mt19937ar.cc -acc -Minfo -ta=tesla,cc60 -fast -Bstatic_pgi
To perform simulation, run as 
"a.out > data.dat”, where data.dat is the data file.

For the visualization, OpenGL and libpng must be installed. Used compile option on macOS X is as follows:
g++ visualize3D.cc -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL -mmacosx-version-min=10.8 -lpng
To execute the executable file, do as  “./a.out”
For data generated by macropinocytosis_Fig6.cc, the system size parameter in visualize3D.cc should be modified as
#define L 250 -> #define L 430.
The data file dat_Fig.S1_F2.0at2.8.dat was generated by macropinocytosis_FigS1.cc, and is able to be visualized by visualize2D_png.cc.
